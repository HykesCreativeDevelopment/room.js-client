IDEA:
=====

* render markdown?
* clickable commands?
* dirty tab styling for clients when messages received you haven't seen
  * last seen line?
* clickable function/verb links that open editor tab
* codemirror linting
* better alert/confirm?
* cmd-n or something for creating new functions/verbs
  * now that we have cmd-p to edit existing, using eval to create new is annoying
