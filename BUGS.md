BUGS:
=====

* maximum call stack side exceeded when no tabs open
* multi-line colored text not working
* you can add a function/verb on top of one that already exists
* scroll to bottom of client on tab switch

TODO:
=====

* better color styles
* style anchor tags
* convert existing db to new format

IDEA:
=====

* dirty tab styling for clients when messages received you haven't seen
  * last seen line?
* clickable function/verb links that open editor tab
* codemirror linting
* command-p style fuzzy searching of functions/verbs
* better alert/confirm?
